# Input Data Model
This document describes the data model for the [problem instances](problem_instances).

## Data Model of the Problem Instances

A _problem instance_, or a _scenario_, is a JSON file containing the following top-level elements:
* label
* hash
* service_intentions (a fancy name for 'train including all its requirements')
* routes
* resources
* parameters

Let's go through them. You may use the small [sample scenario](sample_files/sample_scenario.json) as a concrete example. This looks like this: It contains just 2 trains to be scheduled, 2 routes (one for each train), and 13 resources.

![](documentation/img/scenario_top_level.png)


### label
This is just a human-readable identifier for the instance. It is of no concern otherwise.

### hash
A machine-readable identifier for the instance. This hash must be referenced when submitting a solution for this instance. See [Output Data Model](documentation/output_data_model.md#problem_instance_hash-verkehrsplanhash).

### service_intentions
This is the list of trains (or, in fancy speech, a "service") to be scheduled. Each individual _service_intention_ describes a specific train. In particular, it specifies which _route_ a train can take (see below) and **all requirements** that the scheduler needs to observe when planning this particular train. In the [example](sample_files/sample_scenario.json), we have two _service_intentions_:

![](documentation/img/service_intentions.png)

#### service intention
An individual _service_intention_ looks like this:

![](documentation/img/service_intention.png)

In general, it consists of
* id: identifier for the train, or "service"
* route: a reference to the route graph, see [below](#routes) for details on the routes
* section_requirements: a list of individual _section_requirements_. This is where the actual requirements for this train(service) are specified. Before we look at these (subsection [section_requirements](#section-requirement) below), it is helpful to first discuss the model for the _routes_.

Our example above has three _section_requirements_ for train 111. We will study the meaning of the section requirements in detail below, but for the moment you may think of them as follows:

* The first one specifies that basically the train starts in 'A0 and must not depart before 08:20:00
* The second one says that for some intermediate stop in 'B' (this will match to a certain position in the _route_ of this train), a minimum stopping time of 3 minutes must be observed and the train must not leave 'B' before 08:30:00
* Finally, the third one requires that the train arrive in 'C' no later than 08:50:00

### routes
Recall from the [Quick Introduction](documentation/quick_introduction.md) that a _route_ is modeled as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). It describes the possible ways for the train to move through the railway network. The nodes in the graph are the _events_ that occur along the way, such as "arrival at station X", "releasing resource Y", etc. A directed arc in the route graph is called a _route_section_. For a route_section, we call the node at its tail the _entry event_ and the node at its head the _exit event_ from this route_section. The route_sections have associated with them a list of _resource occupations_. These are the resources that a train on this route will occupy, while it is traveling on this arc, i.e. in the timespan between the entry event and the exit event. Each arc also has a minimum running time, which gives the _minimum_ duration between entry and exit event. There is no maximum duration, by the way. A train may spend as much time on a section as it likes. Of course, it keeps using the resources of this route section during this time.

As an example, we again look at our [sample scenario](sample_files/sample_scenario.json). The following images illustrate route 111 in that scenario (although route 113 is identical):

![](documentation/img/route_sample.png)

#### A _route_ as a directed acyclic graph (DAG)

In a minute, we explain how to derive a directed graph from the data in the JSON. But I give you the picture first. The DAG for route 111 actually looks as follows: Nodes are the _events_ and arcs are the individual _route_sections_. The red labels are _route_alternative_markers_ (see the explanation on _route paths_ just below), the black labels are the _sequence_number_ of the individual _route_section_.

![](documentation/img/route_graph_with_legend.png)

__Note__: There is also a [helper script](ToDo) that constructs a [networkx](https://networkx.github.io/) graph for each service intention in a problem instance. You are free to use it for the challenge if you find it helpful.

#### How is this Graph modeled in the JSON?
Modeling a graph in a JSON structure in a human-readabl way is not exactly a joy. We have taken the approach that paths (i.e. linear subgraphs) in the graph can be grouped into so-called _route paths_. Then these _route_paths_ are "glued together" at the appropriate places. We see that route 111 in our [sample scenario](sample_files/sample_scenario.json) is made up of 5 _route_paths_:

![](documentation/img/route_111_route_paths.png)

Each _route_path_ is a path in the route graph. In the following image, all _route_paths_ are encircled for clarity. For example, the green path illustrates the _route_path_ with id=1. It consists of 7 _route_sections_. Similarly, the orange one corresponds to _route_path_ with id=2. It consists only of one _route_section_.

![](documentation/img/route_paths_JSON_and_graph.png)

#### So how are _route_paths_ joined together? 
__Answer:__ By labelling events with the same _route_alternative_marker_label_.

For example, consider again the same _route_paths_ with id 1 and 2: They both specify a marker label 'M1' for the _exit_event_ from the first route section. These are highlighted in the following snapshot:

![](documentation/img/route_graph_marker_labels.png)

Consequently, those events are "merged together" in the resulting graph:

![](documentation/img/route_graph_marker_labels_graph.png)

_Note_: 

* For consistency, _route_section_ 4 of _route_path_ 1 also lists the same marker label 'M1' for its _entry_event_. This makes sense, because this represents the same event as the _exit_event_ from section 1. In other words, all three events are merged into the same node in the graph.
* There are many ways to cut the graph into segments of linear paths. In the end, all that matters is the resulting DAG. The route paths are only an aid for a human editing the file manually.
* "Officially", the _route_alternative_markers_ are modeled as lists. However, you can be assured that in all problem instances for this challenge, this list will have length at most one. In other words, there is never more than one label.

#### _section_markers_ on a _route_section_

A specialty of the route graph are the _section markers_ that may be associated to certain arcs (_route_sections_). These provide the link to the section requirements in the service intentions. We will discuss them in more detail below. In this sample DAG, there are the following _section_markers_ (in blue):

![](documentation/img/route_DAG_section_markers.png)

In the JSON, you find them here:

![](documentation/img/route_section_markers.png)

#### The formal data model of a _route_
In the formal data model, a _route_ has
* an id
* a list of _route_paths_, which themselves are a list of _route_sections_. These are the ineresting objects. They are built as follows

##### _route_section_

As an example, let's look at the _route_section_ with _sequence_number_ 5, located in our sample route 111 of the [example](sample_files/sample_scenario.json). It looks like this:

![](documentation/img/route_section_example.png)

We explain the meaning of the individual fields:

| Field                                                                                         | Format                            | Description    |
| -------------     |-------------      | -----         |
| sequence_number                                                                 | integer                           | an ordering number. The train passes over the route_sections in this order. This is necessary because the JSON specification does not guarantee that the sequence in the file is preserved when deserializing.   |
| penalty                                                                                       | non-negative float                | used in the [objective function](documentation/business_rules.md#objective-function) for the timetable. If a train uses this route_section, this penalty accrues. <br> This field is optional. If it is not present, this is equivalent to penalty = 0.     |
|  route_alternative_marker_at_entry                                          | text                              | a label for the _entry event_ into this route_section. Route sections from other _route_paths_ with the same label are "glued" together, i.e. become the same node in the route graph. See examples [above](#so-how-are-route_paths-joined-together) |
|  route_alternative_marker_at_exit                                         | text                              | dito for the _exit event_ from this route_section    |
| _starting_point_ and _ending_point_                                  | text                              | used in visualisations of the timetable. It has no meaning otherwise. But note that each route_section begins where the last one ends, which, if you think about it, kinda makes sense...    |
|   minimum_running_time                                                           | ISO duration                      | minimum time (duration) the train must spend on this _route_section_|
|   resource_occupations                                                  | List of _resource_occupation_    | see [below](#resource_occupation-ressourcenbelegung)|
|   section_markers                                                     | List of text                      | labels that mark this _route_section_ as a potential section to fulfil a _section_requirement_ that has any of these as _section_marker_. <br>_Note_: In all our problem instances, each _route_section_ has at most one _section_marker_, i.e. the list has length at most one. |

##### _resource_occupation_

| Field                                                                                         | Format                            | Description    |
| -------------     |-------------      | -----         |
| resource                                                     | text                           | a reference to the id of the resource that is occupied |
| occupation_direction                                 | text                           | a description of the direction in which the resource is occupied. This field is only relevant for resources that allow "following" trains, which does not occur in the problem instances for this chalenge. You may ignore this field. See also the description of resources [below](#resources). |

#### Now we we can talk about the _section_requirement_ [element of a [service_intention](#service-intention)]
With the understanding of the routes, the meaning of the _section requirements_ in a service intention now makes more sense.

Each section_requirement references a _section_marker_. This means that "this requirement must be satisfied on any route_section that carries this label as a _section_marker_". The section requirement can specify four types of requirements:
* that a certain time window be respected for the entry event by setting entry_earliest and/or entry_latest accordingly
* same thing for the exit event by setting exit_earliest and/or exit_latest
* a minimum stopping time be observed on this route section by setting min_stopping_time. This stopping time will be _in addition_ to the minimum_running_time
* the _connections_ to other trains to be observed

If this is a bit much to digest, don't worry. We will see in the [planning rules](documentation/business_rules.md) the formal rules that you need to observe when constructing solutions. For now, let's just look at some examples before defining the formal data model:

* _service_intention_ 111 in our [example](sample_files/sample_scenario_with_routing_alternatives.json) has three _section_requirements_: <br>
![](documentation/img/section_requirements_examples.png)
* The first of these is for _section_marker_ 'A'. We said above that this sort of means that "departure from station A" must not occur before 08:20:00. What it __really__ means is: the _entry_event_ into this _route_section_ must not occur before 08:20:00 <br>
![](documentation/img/section_requirements_example_start.png)
* The second is for _section_marker_ 'B' and requires that on the corresponding _route_section_
    - the train spends, in addition to the minimum running time, at least 3 minutes for a commercial stop
    - the train does not "leave this station" before 08:30:00 (more technically: The _exit_event_ from the _route_section_ does not happen before 08:30:00)<br>
    ![](documentation/img/section_requirements_example_intermediate.png)
* The third is for _section_marker_ 'C' and requires that the "arrival at that station" should be no later than 08:40:00<br>
![](documentation/img/section_requirements_example_end.png)
* We give an example for a _connection_ [below](#connections).

Finally _section_requirement_ can specify relative factors _entry_delay_weight_ and _exit_delay_weight_. These weights are used in the calculation of the [objective function](documentation/business_rules.md#objective-function).


Summarizing: The formal model for a _section_requirement_ is as follows

| Field                                                                                         | Format                            | Description    |
| -------------     |-------------      | -----         |
| sequence_number                                                                  | integer                           | Needed because JSON deserialization may not preserve order <br> __Important Note__: If you look at the route graph for service intention 111 [in the example above](#section_markers-on-a-route_section), you see that however you travel through the graph (from a source to a sink node) you will always pass _section_markers_ A, then B and finally C. This is exactly the same sequence as the _section_requirements_ in the _service_intention_. __We guarantee that this is always the case for all our [problem instances](problem_instances), see [Axiom 3](#axiom-3-well-behaved-route-graphs) below!__. That is, the route graphs are such that you will always automatically pass all required _section_markers_ and you will do so in the correct sequence.    |

You may ignore it.   |

#### connections

Connections are directed. They point _from_ a train that gives a connection _to_ another train that accepts the connection. In our model, a connection is listed under the train that _gives_ it.

Here is an example: It is from [problem instance 02](problem_instances/02_a_little_less_dummy.json) ([direct link to the line](problem_instances/02_a_little_less_dummy.json?expanded=true&viewer=simple#L3375)) and specifies a connection from the _service_intention_ '18013' onto _service_intention_ '18224' on _section_marker_ 'WAE_Halt'. A minimum connection time of 2 minutes and 30s must be observed.

![](documentation/img/section_requirements_example_connection.png)

The model is as follows:

| Field                                                                                         | Format                            | Description    |

### resources

Back to the top-level of our [sample scenario](sample_files/sample_scenario.json):

![](documentation/img/resources_example.png)

Resources are used to model which parts of the track infrastructure are used by a train while on a certain _route_section_. A resource that is used is modeled as a _resource_occupation_ on the _route_section_, see [above](#route_section). Resource occupations always begin at the _entry_ into a _route_section_ and end at the _exit_ from a _route_section_. 

_Remark:_ Very often, however, the same resource may be occupied again on the next _route_section_. This corresponds to the fact that trains typically need a wave of several "green signals" ahead of them, where each signal protects the block section to the next one. Each such block section may be considered a resource in our model.

In general, we use two kinds of resources to model different behaviour and level-of-detail:

* _blocking_ resources which means the resource must be released by a train before another train can start occupying them
* _following_ resources, which allow two trains to occupy them concurrently, as long as
    - they are separated at entry and exit by at least the _following_separation_
    - the order of the trains is the same at entry and exit, i.e. they do not overtake each other while using this resource.

**However, in the problem instances provided for this Challenge, you will only find resources of _blocking_ type. To participate in this challenge, it is therefore sufficient for you to consider only blocking logic.**

The model for a _resource_ is as follows:

| Field                                                                                         | Format                            | Description    |
| -------------     |-------------      | -----         |
| id                                                        | text                      | unique identifier for the resource. This is referenced in the _resource_occupations_    |
| release_time                                | ISO duration              | describes how much time must pass between release of a resource by one train and the following occupation by the next train. See [Business Rules](documentation/business_rules.md) for details.  |
|  following_allowed                       | bool                      | flag whether the resource is of _following_ type (true) or of _blocking_ type (false). <br> As mentioned, __all resources in all the provided problem instances have this field set to__ _false_|

### parameters
![](documentation/img/example_parameters.png)
Can be used to set global or solver-specific guidelines for the instance. Do not change these, as it would change the hash of the instance. They are of no concern otherwise.

# 'Axioms' on the Structure of the Problem Instances
We guarantee that all sample files and problem instances used in this challenge have the following properties. Let's call them 'axioms'

### Axiom 1: Start with _entry_earliest_ and end with _exit_latest_
A _service_intention_ always has a _entry_earliest_ time set for its first _section_requirement_ and has an _exit_latest_ time set for its last _section_requirement.<br>For example, here is the [sample instance](sample_files/sample_scenario.json):<br>![](documentation/img/axiom_1.png)
### Axiom 2: A _route_ for each _service_intention_ and vice versa
There is a one-to-one correspondence between _service_intentions_ and _routes_ and moreover, they use the same _id_.<br>For example, the [sample instance](sample_files/sample_scenario.json) has two _service_intentions_, 111 and 113, and two _routes_ with the same _id_:<br>![](documentation/img/axiom_2.png)
### Axiom 3: Well-behaved Route Graphs
The route graph for a _service_intention_ (see the [detailed description](documentation/input_data_model.md#routes) for an in-depth discussion) has the following properties

* It is a directed acyclic graph
* A path from a source node (i.e. from a node without incoming arcs) to a sink node (a node without outgoing arcs) always visits all required _section_markers_ and does so in the correct order (given by the _service_intention_)
* In addition, such a path will always start with a _section_marker_ for the first _section_requirement_ and end with a _section_marker_ for the last _section_requirement_ of the _service_intention_

### Axiom 4: Key for _route_sections_
The _sequence_number_ of a _route_section_ is unique among **all** _route_sections_ in a _route_. For example, _route_ 111 in the [sample instance](sample_files/sample_scenario.json) has 5 _route_paths_, each containing a varying number of _route_sections_. These _sequence_numbers_ are **globally unique** in a _route_. It will never happen that two _route_pahts_ contain _route_sections_ with the same _sequence_number_.<br>![](documentation/img/axiom_4.png)

As a consequence, the pattern <_route_._id_>#<_route_section_._sequence_number_> is a key for a _route_section_ globally over the whole problem instance.
