This is a starter-kit Repo for the [SBB Train Schedule Optimisation Challenge](https://www.crowdai.org/challenges/train-schedule-optimisation-challenge) on [crowdAI](https://www.crowdai.org).

In this repo you will find background material, sample files and support scripts that help you to get started with the challenge.

## How to get started?

This challenge requires a bit of explanation before you can get started. While the general idea is quite simple, and there are only a grand total of twelve rules that need to be taken into account when producing a timetable, the data models used require an introduction.

We recommend that you proceed through the documentation in the following order:

1. **Quick Introduction to the Timetabling Problem**
   First, read the [Quick Introduction to the Timetabling Problem](documentation/quick_introduction.md). After this, you should be able to relate to the problem and start to get a feeling for the algorithmic difficulties involved.
2. **Worked Example**
Second, it is probably a good idea to go through the [Worked Example](documentation/a_worked_example.md). In that document, we take a very simple sample problem, produce a solution from the ground up (in the required solution data format) and then verify that we indeed satisfy all twelve timetabling rules.
3. **General Outline**
After the first two, you may proceed with the further documentation (see [below](#what-can-i-find-in-this-repo)), and maybe start to solve the simple instances in parallel with learning the fine details of the data models and the timetabling rules.

4. **Instance Description**
Once you really want to start solving the instances, you should also check out the [description of the instances](documentation/instance_description.md) 
which gives you an idea about the size (and difficulty) of the problem instances. You should start solving the simple instances first. More information on that in the [description of the instances](documentation/instance_description.md).

5. **How to Submit ?**
The [what to submit](documentation/what_to_submit.md) guide walks you through a sample submission.

## What do I have to do?
You must try to generate solutions to the nine problem instances in [this folder](problem_instances).

Once you have solutions, you can submit them through the [Challenge page on crowdAI](https://www.crowdai.org/challenges/train-schedule-optimisation-challenge/submissions). 

In order to submit, it is __not necessary to solve all nine problem instances__. You can also submit an arbitrary subset of them. However, each missing solution will incur a penalty of 10'000 points. As soon as you manage to find a solution with an objective value better (i.e. lower) than 10'000, you should therefore include that solution in the submission.

By the way, we provide [sample solutions](problem_instances/sample_solutions) to seven of the nine problem instances. These seven solutions are also available as a [sample submission](problem_instances/sample_solutions/sample_submission.json). You may use these solutions to test the submission workflow and verify the data models. You must not use them as a basis for your solver, however, see the according [challenge rules](https://www.crowdai.org/challenges/train-schedule-optimisation-challenge).

The goal is to create a submission with __as small a score as possible__.

## What can I find in this Repo?

* In the [Documentation](documentation) folder you find all documentation texts, such as
    - the [Quick Introduction](documentation/quick_introduction.md) mentioned above
    - the [Worked Example](documentation/worked_example.md)
    - description of the [input data model](documentation/input_data_model.md)
    - description of the [output data model](documentation/output_data_mode.md)
    - definition of the twelve 'timetabling', or [business rules](documentation/business_rules.md)
    - A [description](documentation/instance_description.md) of the nine problem instances that make up the challenge
    - A note on [what and how to submit](documentation/what_to_submit.md)

* The [sample_files](sample_files) folder contains some simple sample instances and solution. We use these in the documentation to explain our data models and the grading function.

* The [problem_instances](problem_instances) folder contains the actual timetabling problem instances that you need to solve for this challenge. Also, you find in a subfolder sample solutions (although not very good ones) to some of the instances and a sample submission.

* The [utils](utils) folder contains some utilities such as
    - a [script](utils/validate_solution.py) to evaluate _individual_ solutions to problem instances without a "formal" submission. This is very helpful when trying to tune your algorithms. There is also an accompanying [notebook](utils/validate_solution.ipynb) explaining its use. 
    - a [script](utils/route_graph.py) that transforms the routes in a problem instance into directed graphs in the [networkx](https://networkx.github.io/) package. You may find this useful when trying to work with the route graph algorithmically in your solver, or just for visualization purposes.
